- **Ask follow-ups** - Build on previous responses
- **Reference details** - Mention specific events or actions

### Getting Insights

- **Ask "why"** - Understand root causes
- **Request comparisons** - Compare time periods or segments
- **Get recommendations** - Ask for improvement suggestions

## Troubleshooting

### Chat Not Responding

- **Check connection** - Ensure you're connected to the internet
- **Wait for response** - AI analysis may take a few seconds
- **Try rephrasing** - Restate your question differently

### Incorrect Answers

- **Provide more context** - Include session IDs or time ranges
- **Be more specific** - Narrow down your question
- **Check data** - Verify sessions exist and have data

### Session Not Found

- **Verify session ID** - Check the session ID is correct
- **Check permissions** - Ensure you have access to the project
- **Confirm existence** - Verify the session exists

## Tips

### Quick Analysis

Use chat for quick insights without navigating multiple pages:

"What's our conversion rate?"
```
