# Session Replays

Session replays let you watch exactly what users did in your application, helping you understand user behavior, debug issues, and improve your product.

## Accessing Session Replays

### Navigate to Replays

1. Open the Signal app
2. Click **Replays** in the sidebar
3. You'll see a list of all recorded sessions

## Session List

### Viewing Sessions

The session list shows:

- **Session ID** - Unique identifier for each session
- **User** - User information (if identified)
- **Duration** - How long the session lasted
- **Events** - Number of events recorded
- **Tags** - Auto tags applied to the session
- **Last Updated** - When the session was recorded

### Filtering Sessions

Use filters to find specific sessions:

1. **Date Range** - Filter by when sessions occurred
2. **Auto Tags** - Filter by tags (e.g., "Bug encountered", "Payment failure")
3. **User** - Filter by specific user
4. **Search** - Search by session ID or user ID

### Sorting Sessions

- **Most Recent** - Latest sessions first
- **Oldest First** - Oldest sessions first
- **Longest** - Sessions by duration
- **Most Events** - Sessions by event count

## Viewing a Session Replay

1. Click on a session in the list
2. The session replay opens in a new view
3. Watch the replay of user interactions

### Replay Controls

- **Play/Pause** - Control playback

- **Timestamps** - When logs occurred

## Using Session Replays

### Debugging Issues

1. **Find error sessions** - Filter by "Bug encountered" tag
2. **Watch the replay** - See what led to the error
3. **Check network** - Inspect failed API calls
4. **Review console** - Check for JavaScript errors
5. **Identify root cause** - Understand what went wrong

### Understanding User Behavior

1. **Watch user flows** - See how users navigate your app
2. **Identify friction** - Find where users struggle
3. **Track conversions** - See what leads to conversions
4. **Analyze drop-offs** - Understand why users leave

### Improving UX

1. **Find pain points** - Identify confusing areas
2. **Test assumptions** - Verify how users actually use features
3. **Optimize flows** - Improve user journeys
4. **Measure impact** - See how changes affect behavior

## Sharing Sessions

### Copy Session Link

1. Open a session
2. Click **Share** or copy the URL
3. Share the link with your team

### Export Session Data

1. Open a session
2. Click **Export**
3. Download session data as JSON

## Best Practices

### Finding Relevant Sessions

- **Use tags** - Filter by auto tags to find specific types of sessions
- **Filter by date** - Focus on recent sessions
- **Search by user** - Find sessions from specific users
- **Sort by events** - Find sessions with many events

### Analyzing Sessions

- **Watch full replays** - Don't skip to errors, see the full context
- **Check multiple sessions** - Look for patterns across sessions
- **Review insights** - Use AI-generated insights as starting points
- **Correlate events** - Connect user actions with network requests

### Using Insights

- **Read all insights** - Don't just focus on errors
- **Look for patterns** - Common issues across sessions
- **Prioritize issues** - Focus on high-impact problems
- **Track improvements** - Monitor if issues are resolved

## Troubleshooting

### Replay Not Loading

- **Check session data** - Ensure session has replay data
- **Verify permissions** - Ensure you have access to the project
- **Try refreshing** - Reload the page

### Missing Events

- **Check date range** - Ensure events occurred in the time period
- **Verify tracking** - Confirm events are being sent
- **Review filters** - Check if filters are excluding events

### Slow Playback

- **Reduce speed** - Use slower playback speeds
- **Check network** - Ensure good internet connection
- **Close other tabs** - Free up browser resources
