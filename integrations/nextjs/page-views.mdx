# Next.js — Page views

Next.js can track page views automatically on route changes, or you can use hooks for manual control.

## Automatic: trackPageViews

With `SignalNextProvider`, set `trackPageViews={true}` (default) to send a `$pageview` on every client-side route change:

```tsx
<SignalNextProvider options={{ ... }} trackPageViews>
  {children}
</SignalNextProvider>
```

No extra code is required. The provider uses the App Router’s pathname and (optionally) search params.

## Optional: trackSearchParams

Set `trackSearchParams={true}` to include URL search params in page view events. This uses `useSearchParams()`, so the tracker must be inside a Suspense boundary. The provider handles this when `trackSearchParams` is true.

```tsx
<SignalNextProvider options={{ ... }} trackPageViews trackSearchParams>
  {children}
</SignalNextProvider>
```

## Manual: usePageView and usePageViewWithSearchParams

For more control, use the hooks re-exported from `@signal-js/nextjs/client`:

- **usePageView(options?)** — Sends `$pageview` when the component mounts and when pathname changes. Options: `trackSearchParams`, `additionalProperties`.
- **usePageViewWithSearchParams(options?)** — Same but always includes search params; must be used inside a Suspense boundary.

You can use these instead of (or in addition to) automatic tracking by rendering a component that calls the hook once in your layout.

For **named page views** (e.g. `$pageview_product`), use `useSignalCapture()` and call `capture('$pageview_product', { ... })` inside a `useEffect` when the route or context changes.
