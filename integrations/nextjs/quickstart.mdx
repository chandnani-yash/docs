# Next.js Integration

Use Signal JS with Next.js using the **@signal-js/nextjs** package. It provides client components (SignalNextProvider, hooks) and server utilities (createSignalServer). You add a **getSessionInfo()** helper in `lib/signal-server.ts` (see [Initialization](/docs/integrations/nextjs/initialization)) to read tracing headers for session correlation.

## Quick start

1. **Install** — `npm install @signal-js/nextjs`
2. **Client** — Wrap your app with `SignalNextProvider` in a client providers file and add it to your root layout. See [Initialization](/docs/integrations/nextjs/initialization).
3. **Server** — Create a shared `signal` client with `createSignalServer` and a `getSessionInfo()` helper in `lib/signal-server.ts`. See [Initialization](/docs/integrations/nextjs/initialization).
4. **Track events** — Use hooks on the client and `signal.capture()` on the server with session identifiers. See [Capture](/docs/integrations/nextjs/capture) and [Server tracking](/docs/integrations/nextjs/server-tracking).

## Features

- **App Router support** — Full support for Next.js 13+ App Router
- **Pages Router support** — Compatible with Pages Router
- **Server-side tracking** — Track events from API routes and server actions
- **Session correlation** — Link client and server events using tracing headers
- **Page view tracking** — Automatic page view tracking on route changes

## Best practices

1. Use environment variables — Store credentials in `.env.local`.
2. Use addTracingHeaders only when needed — Set in `options` only if you track server-side events and want correlation.
3. Track server events — Pass `sessionId` and `windowId` from request headers to `signal.capture()` so events link to the same session replay.
4. Separate client/server configs — Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side variables.
5. Use sessionRecordingMasking — Add `signal-no-capture`, `signal-mask`, or `signal-ignore-input` classes to sensitive UI.
