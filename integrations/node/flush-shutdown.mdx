# Node — Flush and shutdown

Flush queued events immediately with `flush()`, or stop the flush timer and flush with `shutdown()` before process exit. Both are async (return a Promise).

## flush()

Flush all queued events to the server immediately.

```typescript
await signal.flush();
```

Use when you need to ensure events are sent before a response or before the process exits (e.g. in a serverless function or after a critical path).

## shutdown()

Stop the flush timer and flush remaining events. Call before process exit for graceful shutdown.

```typescript
await signal.shutdown();
```

Use in cleanup handlers (e.g. `process.on('SIGTERM', ...)`) so no events are lost when the process exits.
