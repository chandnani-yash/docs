# Vue / Browser — Recording control

Control session replay recording and event flushing.

## start()

Start session replay recording. Returns a Promise.

**When to use:** Manually start recording if you didn't call it during initialization, or restart recording after stopping.

```javascript
await signal.start();
```

## stop()

Stop session replay recording. Stops rrweb recorder, network capture, and console capture.

**When to use:** Stop recording when the user navigates away or when you want to disable tracking temporarily.

```javascript
signal.stop();
```

## pauseRecording()

Pause recording temporarily. Events are not captured while paused.

**When to use:** Pause recording for sensitive operations (e.g. payment forms, password entry) without fully stopping.

```javascript
signal.pauseRecording();
```

## resumeRecording()

Resume recording after pausing.

**When to use:** Resume recording after a sensitive operation is complete.

```javascript
signal.resumeRecording();
```

## flush()

Flush all queued events to the server immediately. Returns a Promise.

**When to use:** Before page unload, before navigation, or when you need to ensure events are sent immediately.

```javascript
await signal.flush();
```

## dispose()

Shutdown the SDK and clean up resources. Stops recording, flushes events, and removes event listeners. Returns a Promise.

**When to use:** When the app is being destroyed or when you want to completely remove the SDK.

```javascript
await signal.dispose();
```

## Vue example

```vue
<script setup>
import { onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue'
import { createSignal } from '@signal-js/browser'

let signal = null

onMounted(async () => {
  signal = createSignal({ endpoint: '...', apiKey: '...', projectId: '...' })
  await signal.start()
})

onUnmounted(async () => {
  // Flush events before component unmounts
  await signal?.flush()
})

function handleSensitiveAction() {
  signal?.pauseRecording()
  // ... perform sensitive operation
  signal?.resumeRecording()
}
</script>
```

## Vanilla JS example

```javascript
const signal = createSignal({ endpoint: '...', apiKey: '...', projectId: '...' });
await signal.start();

// Pause for sensitive operation
signal.pauseRecording();
// ... perform sensitive operation
signal.resumeRecording();

// Flush before page unload
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', async () => {
  await signal.flush();
});

// Dispose when app is destroyed
window.addEventListener('unload', async () => {
  await signal.dispose();
});
```

## Example: Conditional recording

```javascript
const signal = createSignal({ endpoint: '...', apiKey: '...', projectId: '...' });

if (userConsent) {
  await signal.start();
} else {
  // Don't start recording
}

// Later, if user consents
function enableTracking() {
  signal.start();
}
```
