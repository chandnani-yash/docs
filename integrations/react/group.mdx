# React — Group

Associate the current user with a group (e.g. company, organization) and optionally set group properties. Use `useSignalGroup()` to get `group` and `getGroups`.

## useSignalGroup

```tsx
import { useSignalGroup } from '@signal-js/react';

function CompanySwitcher({ companies }) {
  const { group, getGroups } = useSignalGroup();

  const handleSelectCompany = (companyId, companyName) => {
    group('company', companyId, { name: companyName });
  };

  return (
    <select onChange={(e) => {
      const c = companies.find(c => c.id === e.target.value);
      if (c) handleSelectCompany(c.id, c.name);
    }}>
      {companies.map((c) => (
        <option key={c.id} value={c.id}>{c.name}</option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
}
```

## group(groupType, groupKey, properties?)

- **groupType** (`string`) — Type of group (e.g. `'company'`, `'organization'`).
- **groupKey** (`string`) — Unique identifier for the group.
- **properties** (`Record<string, unknown>` optional) — Group properties to set.

Calling `group()` sends a group association event and can set or update group properties. Subsequent events may include this group context for analytics.

## getGroups

`getGroups()` returns the list of groups the user is currently associated with (from the SDK state). Useful for debugging or conditional UI.
